# Java Training Programs

This repository contains a set of small Java programs that I've created to improve my Java programming skills. These exercises cover various aspects of the Java language and are intended to complement my coursework. I found these exercises on YouTube and used them as a basis for my own implementations.

## How to Use These Programs

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the program folder you want to run (e.g., "Program1/").
3. Compile and run the program using your preferred Java development environment.
